  <h2>Description</h2>
  <p>
    If you're looking for a quick and easy game day appetizer that you can easily scale up to serve a crowd, look no further than these Sweet & Spicy Air Fryer Meatballs! The pork meatballs incorporate both gochujang and gochugaru (Korean red pepper flakes) to really hammer home those delicious spices, then they’re air fried to golden brown perfection. Finally, they get tossed in a sweet and spicy sauce made from gochujang and peach and apricot preserves. Grape jelly would even work in this recipe too! I served mine with a side of rank for dipping and to help cool off some of that heat. Deeeelicious!!

  <h2>Ingredients</h2>
  <ul>
    <p>Meatballs:</p>
    <li>1 lb 90/10 lean ground pork</li>
    <li>1 large egg</li>
    <li>1/4 cup Italian seasoned breadcrumbs (28 grams)</li>
    <li>1/4 cup Wegmans Italian cheese blend, grated (Pecorino Romano and Parmigiano Reggiano) (20 grams)</li>
    <li>1 tbsp O'Food Gochujang Korean Chili Sauce (18 grams)</li>
    <li>1 tsp Korean red pepper flakes or chili powder</li>
    <li>1 tsp Flavor God Garlic Lover's Seasoning</li>
    <li>1/2 tsp salt</li>
    <li>1/2 tsp black pepper</li>
    <p>Sauce:</p>
    <li>3 tbsp apricot and peach preserves (120 grams)</li>
    <li>2 tbsp O'Food Gochujang Korean Chili Sauce (36 grams)</li>
    <p>Optional toppings:</p>
    <li>Green onions, chopped</li>
    <li>Sesame seeds</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Instructions</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>Add all meatball ingredients to a large bowl and combine with your hands until the
        ingredients are well distributed in the ground pork. Use a cookie scoop to help form
        meatballs, rolling them in your hands to create smooth, round balls about 1 to 1.5" in
        diameter. Set the raw meatballs aside on a baking sheet.</li>
    <li>Pre-heat air fryer to 400°F. After pre-heating, I like to add a parchment paper liner to
        my air fryer tray to make cleanup easy. Add meatballs to your air fryer tray in a single
        layer, being careful not to overcrowd. (Depending on the size of your air fryer, you may
        need to cook these in 2 batches.)</li>
    <li>Air fry meatballs for 8-10 minutes or until cooked through. Once cooked, remove meatballs
        from air fryer tray with tongs, allowing excess juices to drip off for a moment before
        moving the meatballs to a bowl.</li>
    <li>Whisk apricot preserves and gochujang until well blended, then pour over meatballs and toss
        until evenly coated. Top meatballs with sesame seeds and green onions before serving, if
        desired.</li>
  </ol>
